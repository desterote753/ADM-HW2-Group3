    "Estimate the time complexity of the following code, especially for the \"?\"-Command and in the \"?\"-case respectively: [above code inserted]\n",

    "**Answer by ChatGPT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the provided code is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the \"L\" and \"R\" commands, the time complexity is **O(1)**. This is because adding an element to a dictionary in Python is a constant time operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the \"?\" command, the time complexity is also **O(1)**. This is because looking up an element in a Python dictionary is a constant time operation, and the mathematical operations (like subtraction and the min function) are also constant time operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So overall, the time complexity of the code is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of commands to be executed. This is due to the fact that each command is executed once in a for loop. Each command has a constant time complexity, so the total time complexity is linear with respect to the number of commands.\n",

    "- performing a \"continue\" (i.e. jump in the code),\n",
    "- looking up a value in dictionary (! this is done by hashing and hence constant!)\n",

    "Since every computation inside the loop needs only constant time and there are finitely many computations inside the loop, the loop itself has time-complexity O(n), where n is the number of iterations of the loop or the number of incoming commands, respectively.\n",
    "Since before the loop there are only constant-timte-computations and there is no code after the loop we have a time-complexity for the whole code of O(n).\n",

For example consider a string with n entries, each separated by a comma. Then similiar to a binary-tree it could be split easily (parallely) in O(log(n)). If the input could be directly transformed into a dictionary even faster input is thinkable.\n",
